This plugin allows you to restrict not logged-in users from accessing BuddyPress pages


== Description ==

Buddypress pages are public by default. This plugin allows you to restrict not logged-in users from accessing these pages.

If an anonymous user tries to access these pages, they will be redirected either to the login page, or to the homepage, or even to a custom page. 

The plugin also allows to display on these pages a template with a message to log in instead of directly redirecting them elsewhere.


== Features ==

- Very easy to use, you only have to choose which pages want to retrict to anonymous users (not logged-in users).
- Small and lightweight plugin (around 10-15kb).
- No CSS, no scripts. No requests to static files.
- Fully translated into Spanish.
